          <p>
            I am See Man Teng, from Singapore studying in NUS as an Information Systems 
            major and I love all things tech! I enjoy creating my own side projects during 
            my free time and playing around with open source libraries.
          </p>
          <p>
            Beyond tech, I also love fitness, chess and learning new languages. I do both 
            long and short distance running, weight training, swimming and cycling.
          </p>
          <p>
            I love challenging myself, meeting new people and learning new things! Do drop 
            a connect with me even if it's just to make friends :)
